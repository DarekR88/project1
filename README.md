"Hot this Weekend" is an app aimed at people of all ages who enjoy concerts and events.
The user will enter in a zip code and the apis utilized in this app will return concerts, events and 5 days worth of weather.
the purpose of this is to allow people to plan their weekend based around an event and the kind of weather they can expect.
If the weather does not show up the problem probably lies with the acuuweather.com api call. There are a limited number of calls that can be made per day.
